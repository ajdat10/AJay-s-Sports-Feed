# AJay's Sports Feed

## What is it? ## 
 For my project I've decided to make a sports feed site where it displays infomation about a team you chose from. 

## The user will be able to do the following:

1. Go to the main URL page and see a selection for 3 choices to choose from 

2. When the user chooses a league they will be redirected to another page 

3. On this second page they will be asked to choose a team of their choice from a dropdown to get info back on that specific team

## Example of a function: 
To get information from the result of the dropdown I had to create a function to access this infomation from the API I used:
